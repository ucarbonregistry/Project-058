3.5 MW Small Scale Hydro Power project by M/S Shiva Energy Resources Pvt. Ltd., Himachal Pradesh
The proposed project activity with title under UCR “3.5 MW (2X 1.75 MW) Small Scale Hydro Power project by M/S Shiva Energy Resources Pvt. Ltd.”, is a grid connected Hydro Electric Power project located in Shimla district in the state of Himachal Pradesh (India). The project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently registered under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

Country : India

State : Himachal Pradesh

District : Shimla

Village : Kinnu & Bari
The project location is situated near village Kinnu and Bari of Shimla district in the state of Himachal 
Pradesh. The nearest major railway station to the project site is Shimla Railway Station located about 
196 kms. The Project site is about 28 kms from Shimla-Kinnaur highway Road. 

The geographic coordinate of the project locations is 31°27'47.4"N 77°50'20.5"E.

The project activity aims to harness kinetic energy of water (renewable source) to generate electricity. 
The net generated electricity from the project activity is sold to state electricity board i.e., Himachal
Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB) under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed
between the Project Proponent (PP) and the utility. 

In pre-project scenario, electricity delivered to the 
grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of fossil fuel-based 
grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new fossil fuel-based generation sources in the 
grid. Currently, NEWNE grid is connected to large numbers of fossil fuel-based power plants. Hence,
project activity is displacing the gross electricity generation i.e., 48,882 MWh from the NEWNE grid.
The project activity doesn’t involve any GHG emission sources.
